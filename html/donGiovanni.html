            <h2><span class="text-blue">Don Giovanni</span> Info from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Giovanni" target="_blank"><span class="text-green">Wiki</span></a> :</h2>
            <p>Don Giovanni (Italian pronunciation: [dɔn dʒoˈvanni]; K. 527; complete title: Il dissoluto punito, ossia il Don Giovanni, literally The Rake Punished, or Don Giovanni or The Libertine Punished) is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It is based on the legends of Don Juan, a fictional libertine and seducer, written by Tirso de Molina. It was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the National Theater (of Bohemia), now called the Estates Theatre, on 29 October 1787.[1] Da Ponte's libretto was billed as a dramma giocoso, a common designation of its time that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action. Mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an opera buffa. Although sometimes classified as comic, it blends comedy, melodrama and supernatural elements.</p>

                <p>Don Giovanni is generally regarded as one of Mozart's supreme achievements and one of the greatest operas of all time,[2] and it has proved a fruitful subject for writers and philosophers. A staple of the standard operatic repertoire, it has been described by critic Fiona Maddocks as one of Mozart's "trio of masterpieces with libretti by Ponte".[3]</p>
                
                <h2>Composition and premiere</h2>
            <p>The opera was commissioned after the success of Mozart's trip to Prague in January and February 1787.[4] The subject may have been chosen due to the genre of eighteenth-century Don Juan opera having originated in Prague.[5]</p>

                <p>Lorenzo Da Ponte's libretto is based on Giovanni Bertati's for the opera Don Giovanni Tenorio, which premiered in Venice early in 1787. Two important elements he copied were opening the drama with the murder of the Commendatore, and not specifying Seville as the setting. For Bertati, the setting was Villena, Spain, while Da Ponte uses a "city in Spain".[6]</p>
                
                <p>Don Giovanni was planned to premiere on 14 October 1787 for Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria’s visit. As the production was not ready Le nozze di Figaro was substituted instead.[7] The score was completed on 28 or 29 October 1787. Mozart recorded the completion of the opera on 28 October, the night before its premiere.[4]</p>
                
                <p>The score calls for double woodwinds, two horns, two trumpets, three trombones (alto, tenor, bass), timpani, basso continuo for the recitatives, and the usual string section. The composer also specified occasional special musical effects. For the ballroom scene at the end of the first act, Mozart calls for two onstage ensembles to play separate dance music in synchronization with the pit orchestra, each of the three groups playing in its own metre (a 3/4 minuet, a 2/4 contradanse and a fast 3/8 peasant dance), accompanying the dancing of the principal characters. In act 2, Giovanni is seen to play the mandolin, accompanied by pizzicato strings. In the same act, two of the Commendatore's interventions ("Di rider finirai pria dell'aurora" and "Ribaldo, audace, lascia a' morti la pace") are accompanied by a wind chorale of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and trombones (with cellos and basses playing from the string section).</p>
                
                <p>The opera was first performed on 29 October 1787 in Prague under its full title of Il dissoluto punito ossia il Don Giovanni – Dramma giocoso in due atti (The Rake punished, or Don Giovanni, a dramma giocoso in two acts). The work was rapturously received, as was often true of Mozart's work in Prague. The Prager Oberpostamtzeitung reported, "Connoisseurs and musicians say that Prague has never heard the like," and "the opera … is extremely difficult to perform."[8] The Provincialnachrichten of Vienna reported, "Herr Mozart conducted in person and was welcomed joyously and jubilantly by the numerous gathering."[9]</p>
            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p>Don Giovanni, a young,[19] arrogant, and sexually promiscuous nobleman, abuses and outrages everyone else in the cast until he encounters something he cannot kill, beat up, dodge, or outwit.</p>
